This is the summary of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model described as a sequential model in Keras.
Let's break down the summary:

Model Architecture:
Model Type: Sequential
The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers where you can simply add one layer at a time.
Layers:
Convolutional Layer 1 (conv2d):

Type: Conv2D
Output Shape: (None, 62, 62, 32)
Parameters: 896
This layer applies 32 filters of size 3x3 to the input. The output has dimensions 62x62 with 32 channels.
Convolutional Layer 2 (conv2d_1):

Type: Conv2D
Output Shape: (None, 60, 60, 32)
Parameters: 9,248
This layer applies another set of 32 filters to the previous layer's output, resulting in a smaller spatial resolution.
Convolutional Layer 3 (conv2d_2):

Type: Conv2D
Output Shape: (None, 58, 58, 32)
Parameters: 9,248
Similar to the previous layers, this convolutional layer further reduces the spatial dimensions.
Max Pooling Layer (max_pooling2d):

Type: MaxPooling2D
Output Shape: (None, 29, 29, 32)
This layer performs max pooling with a 2x2 pool size, reducing the spatial dimensions by half.
Flatten Layer (flatten):

Type: Flatten
Output Shape: (None, 26,912)
This layer flattens the 3D output to a 1D array, preparing it for the fully connected layers.
Dense Layer 1 (dense):

Type: Dense (fully connected)
Output Shape: (None, 32)
Parameters: 861,216
This dense layer with 32 units connects every neuron from the previous layer.
Dense Layer 2 (dense_1):

Type: Dense (fully connected)
Output Shape: (None, 6)
Parameters: 198
The final dense layer with 6 units, corresponding to the number of classes in the classification task.
Total Parameters:
Total parameters: 880,806
Trainable parameters: 880,806
Non-trainable parameters: 0
Parameter Explanation:
The "parameters" represent the weights and biases in the model.
"Trainable parameters" are those that will be updated during training.
"Non-trainable parameters" are constants (e.g., batch normalization parameters) that are not updated during training.
This model seems to be designed for a classification task with 6 classes, and it utilizes convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The model takes input images of size 64x64 pixels and outputs a probability distribution over the 6 classes.
