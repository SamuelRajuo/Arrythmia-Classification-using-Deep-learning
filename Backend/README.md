This is a Python script using the Flask web framework to create a simple web application for predicting ECG (Electrocardiogram) abnormalities using a pre-trained neural network model.
Here's an explanation of the code:

Import Statements:

os: Provides a way to interact with the operating system, used for handling file paths.
numpy (np): A library for numerical operations in Python.
Flask: A web framework for building web applications.
request: Allows handling of HTTP requests in Flask.
render_template: Renders HTML templates for web pages.
load_model from keras.models: Loads a pre-trained neural network model.
image from keras.preprocessing: Provides functions for image preprocessing.
Image, ImageOps from PIL: Python Imaging Library for handling images.
Flask App Setup:

An instance of the Flask app is created with app = Flask(__name__).
The pre-trained neural network model is loaded using load_model("D:\ECG\ECG.h5").
Routes and HTML Templates:

The app defines several routes using the @app.route decorator, each associated with a specific HTML template.
/: Displays an "About" page.
/home: Displays a "Home" page.
/info: Displays an "Info" page.
/upload: Displays a page for uploading an ECG image for prediction.
HTML templates for each page are expected to be present in the "templates" folder.
Image Upload and Prediction:

The /upload route is designed to handle POST requests.
When an image is uploaded, it is saved to the "uploads" folder in the same directory as the script.
The uploaded image is preprocessed (converted to grayscale, resized, and expanded dimensions).
The pre-trained neural network model (model) predicts the class probabilities for the input image.
The predicted class is determined, and the corresponding class label is retrieved from the index list.
The result is then returned as a string.
Error Handling:

If any exceptions occur during the image processing or prediction, an error message is printed, and an appropriate message is returned.
Main Block:

The script checks if it is being run as the main program (if __name__ == "__main__":) and starts the Flask development server if so (app.run(debug=True)).
To use this application, you need to have the required libraries installed (Flask, keras, numpy, PIL) and a pre-trained model file named "ECG.h5" in the specified directory. Additionally, ensure that the "templates" and "uploads" folders are present in the same directory as the script.
